StarGODecompressor v1.0
=======================
Made by: Koushi (https://twitter.com/tanoshii_koushi)

This tool decompresses the *GO archives on the Jak II PS2 disc.
(*GO means both CGO and DGO!)
Decompressed files are sent to: "name.U*GO" where:
'name' is the name of the input *GO file.

Usage:
StarGODecompressor <[-f file_path] [-d directory_path]>

Log File:
log.txt contains all the logged information.
To verify that there are no errors, search the log for "!!!" -- no occurences means everything properly extracted.

As far as my tool goes, feel free to do whatever with it so long as you share the source code for your modifications.
All I ask is you credit me! :)
